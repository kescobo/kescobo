Feel free to [be in touch](https://blog.bonham.ch/contact/)!

I also write open-source software for the [julia programming language](http://julialang.org/)
and host a podcast about the immune system called [Audiommunity](https://audiommunity.org).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on tools for analyzing spatial transcriptomics data
  and graph representations of gut microbiome data
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning graph theory and Bayesian analysis
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the julia programming langauge, molecular biology, microbiology, immunology

### Code

Most of my code is here on github,
including [the code](https://github.com/kescobo/blog.bonham.ch/) for [my website](https://blog.bonham.ch).
Some other code is [on gitlab](https://gitlab.com/kescobo),
though I mostly put private repos there.
